# Paper Soccer
Simple paper soccer game made in GTK for fun. Minimax AI is also implemented. It probably misuses GTK functions in some places, but it was a hobby project with the purpose of beating my friend using implemented AI, so I just wanted to make it work as fast as possible and I didn't put much effort into this code.

## Game Controls
You can use mouse or QWEADZXC keys to move the ball. You'll get the hang of it once you start playing.
